# ISOMAGIC

Easily rename PS2 game file names and prefix them with the correct game codes for OPL Manager to interpret.

I made this script for a friend who has the need for this exact functionality. The repo includes an executable version of the script for his convenience. If you dont want to trust a random exe which is smart then just clone the repo and run the python script yourself.


### EXE Version
This repo includes an exe version of the script that you can use if you don't want to install python.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.12.3 or higher

### Installation & Usage

To use this script you will need to have python installed.

1. Install Python
2. Install pip
3. Install requirements

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Omit 'source' in Windows)
source .venv/Scripts/activate

# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
